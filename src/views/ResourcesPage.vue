      <h1>Cats and Kittens</h1>
      <p>A general certificate of health is not required by CDC for entry of pet cats into the United States, although some airlines or states may require them. However, pet cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry into the United States if they have evidence of an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans. If a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the ownerâ€™s expense might be required at the port of entry.</p>
      <p>Cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States. However, some states require vaccination of cats for rabies, so it is a good idea to check with state and local health authorities at your final destination.</p>
      <p>Exotic cats, such as Bengal cats and Savannah cats must be cleared by USFWS upon import. This even applies to cats that are more than four generations removed from the pure bred specimen, which are classified as domestic cats by USDA.</p>
